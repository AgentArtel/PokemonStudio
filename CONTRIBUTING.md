# How to contribute

This repository contains the json file generate by Pok√©mon Studio while creating a new project. Those files might contain data error introduced over time (they come from Ruby Host).

If you'd like to help Studio having better data, you can copy the Data from this repository into a new project where you can edit the data using Studio. Once you've fixed what you can, create a Pull Request, [see github documentation about how to deal with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## How to get Studio in your language

We're open to any language as long it has a language code in your own browser (type `navigator.language` in developer tool to know).

If you want to contribute into having your language in Studio, please join our [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/143824995867557888.svg?logo=discord&colorB=728ADA&label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/0noB0gBDd91B8pMk) and ask Aerun.
